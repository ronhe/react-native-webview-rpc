# React-Native WebView RPC Example
This is a very simple React-Native app bootstrapped with the
[Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/)
tool.

## Prequesits
1. Expo CLI. You can install it from NPM:
```bash
$ npm install -g expo-cli
```
2. A running Android/iOS emulator, or a physical device
connected to your development PC.

## Running
1. Clone or download the `rn-webview-rpc` repository.
2. Install the example's app dependencies from NPM:
```bash
example$ npm install
```
3. Run the example app:
```bash
example$ expo start
```


**Note:** It should be simpler to run the example app online
using [Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.io/@git/github.com/ronhe/rn-webview-rpc:example).
However, this doesn't always work for me, so I can't
recommend it.
